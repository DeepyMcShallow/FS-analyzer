FutureSaver - News, Sentiment & Impact Estimator

Easy to use, but wildly inaccurate unit price forecaster.

The concept:

Supply a current FS unit price CSV file, which will be used to compare aginst news items for the holdings in the different investment options.

The Pros:
-Pretty easy to use, just provide the right file and watch it do it's thing.
-The vibe

The Cons/TO DO:
-The weightings of the assumptions need tweaking, plus it's really only accessing and anlyzing the Headlines and summary of the news stories.
It does provide links to those stories, which can be useful, I suppose...
-Accuracy
-Fine tuning
